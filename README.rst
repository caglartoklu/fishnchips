Usage
=====

Editing
-------

Any text editor such as Vim or Emacs is always fine.


If you use Visual Studio, ``.vs`` directory is already added to ``.gitignore`` file.

If you use PyCharm, ``.idea`` directory is already added to ``.gitignore`` file.

When you use PyCharm to inspect the project, "Inspection Results" window will include the ``.eggs`` directory.
To ignore the inspection for that directory, right-click on the directory, select  ``Mark Directory as`` and then select ``Excluded``.

``.private`` or ``_private`` directory (you can create them yourself if you need a directory that will not be tracked by git) are already added to ``.gitignore`` file.
